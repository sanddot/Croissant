          <strong>Croissant</strong>, French pastry that is typically
          crescent-shaped, which is the origin of its French name. Although
          there are earlier culinary references to “croissants,” the first
          recipe for the croissant as it is known today emerged only as recently
          as 1906. The huge growth in popularity of the croissant appears to
          have been a 20th-century sensation.

          The classic crescent-shaped French pastry is made from a yeast-based
          dough, which is rolled and layered to incorporate butter. Because of
          the cost of butter, many bakers use cheaper substitutes such as
          margarine, which means that most bakeries in France offer two types of
          croissants: croissant and croissant au beurre (“croissant with
          butter”). The former tends to be more breadlike, whereas the latter is
          much richer and, predictably, more buttery. A popular habit among
          bakers is to bend the butterless croissant into a distinctive curve
          while straightening out the croissant au beurre so as to distinguish
          clearly between the two.
